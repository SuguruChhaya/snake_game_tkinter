In my snake game, I want to add many selections so that I can make them unique.
Some challenges:
1. Make the game multiplayer(Up to 4 players, The up key will be w, t, i and uparrow)
2. Can team.
3. Make different modes such as time limit mode where I try to eat as many as I can in a certain time, normal mode in which I can play until I die.
time count mode in which I can count the amount of time taken for eating centain amount of apples.
4. I should make it so that I can choose whether I should be able to die or not.
5. Feature: I lose length if I bite my own tail.
6. Feature: In multiplayer mode: If I bite a snake's body, I gain length and they lose length. If I hit them face to face, We repel eachother.
7. Feature: I can choose whether I want to die or live when I hit a wall. If I live, I should appear from the other side of the screen.wddwadwdwacdwacdwc
I looked at some of the features at https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade
8. Feature: Create a loop hole. (2 Apples pop up on the screen, When I eat 1, My head moves to the other apple's place)

I want to import GIFs so that players can see what selecting the setting will look like.
